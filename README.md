Fourier Series Visualization with p5.js <br>
A Fourier series is a summation of harmonically related sinusoidal functions, also known as components or harmonics. 
The result of the summation is a periodic function whose functional form is determined by the choices of cycle length (or period), the number of components, and their 
amplitudes and phase parameters. <br>

Basically, a series of wave patterns which when summed up together results into another pattern. <br>
Or, addition of multiple simple harmonic waves. <br>
